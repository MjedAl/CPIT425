# Encryption/Decryption Online Tool

We have implemented an Encryption/Decryption online tool that encrypt and decrypt a text using either of the Caesar Cipher algorithm or the Rail Fence Cipher algorithm which we studied in the Information Security university course. The tool is an online webpage that was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hosted using Github Pages. Both algorithms use a key to encrypt and decrypt a text and after it produces a ciphertext accordingly, the default key value is 3.

## Objective

We aim to help users to encrypt and decrypt text efficiently using our online tool that support two encryption/decryption algorithms which are Caesar and Rail Fence ciphers.
